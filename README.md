A ðŸ“± React Native App ðŸ“± for my Husband to manage tasks and daily reminders for FFXIV ðŸŽ®

---
## Description
A React Native app that functions as a To-Do List. Based off the Udemy course by Maximillian Schwarzmuller. Modifications made to suit my customer (my husband's) needs. He requested tri-state instances to indicate progression of list:
- yellow: task done, but not turned in
- green:  task completed
- white:  task not started



<p>He also requested a calendar to show the items that are due with push notifcations. A third screen just shows the entire list of ToDos. More features may be developed as he requests them.</p>
